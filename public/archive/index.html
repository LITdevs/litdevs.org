<p>A collection of various memorabilia from LIT Devs history.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="/archive/pukky">Buy Custom Vukkies</a> - a joke page pretending to sell custom Vukkies. This idea would later be used for Pukkies, which are free versions that otherwise are the damn same.</li>
    <li><a href="https://osvb.litdevs.org">Vukkybox</a> - a little gacha game, you might have heard of it</li>
